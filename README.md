<p> [Ààs å…™-b…ô ä] </p>

### one-of-a-kind Cyberbullying Detection Tool!!

<br>

<p> 
  
Developed by Jana Abusaa and <a href="https://github.com/LourAtwe"> Lour Atwe</a>, CYBU is meant to be the first tool that gives people from different backgrounds the ability to detect any harmful content on their social media accounts.
  
Started from scratch, CYBU was built with least experience in data mining, text classification and deep learning, but now it is in the process of making it known for its high accuracy-models and the fastest detection process!
